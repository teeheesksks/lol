Thanks for having me. I’m currently a P1 Customer Experience Advisor, and I’m applying for P2 because my strongest work happens in deeper, face-to-face conversations where I can assess needs properly, explain options clearly without overstepping into advice, and get everything set up in one go. I’m also the Digital Champion in my branch, so I bring a digital-first mindset alongside strong in-person service. In terms of outcomes, my best month was 63, despite working a 4 day work week, and when I’m fully present on the floor my natural baseline is around 4–5 outcomes a day, with capacity to reach 8 on strong service days. I’m keen to bring that level of consistency into a P2 role and keep building.”

Question 1: Think Customer
“How do you demonstrate in your current role that you are always thinking about the customer, and could you give an example where you proactively helped a customer make their better happen?”

“Day to day, I start by finding the ‘real’ need behind the request. I don’t just complete a transaction and move on. I use open questions to understand what the customer is trying to achieve, what matters most to them, what their usual banking looks like, and what constraints they have, for example time, access to digital, or confidence with technology. That helps me tailor what I explain, so the customer leaves with clarity and a solution that actually fits.”

“A recent example was a customer who came in stressed because they couldn’t work out where their salary was going and felt like they were losing control. I slowed it down, asked a few structured questions to map the situation, then walked them through their accounts and what each one was being used for. I explained practical options in a clear, neutral way, so they could decide what worked best, and I made sure the next steps were realistic for them. They left calmer and confident, and they actually came back later with flowers to thank me. What mattered there wasn’t just the transaction, it was the ownership and removing the stress blocker.”

“In general, I show I’m thinking customer by taking responsibility for the full journey: building rapport quickly, listening properly, using relevant information they’ve shared, then making sure the outcome is safe, appropriate, and doesn’t create repeat visits later.”

Question 2: Act Now
“Can you explain which branch products and services are designed to meet which customer needs?”

“Yes. I think about products in terms of customer need first, then match to the right option and explain it simply.”

“Starting with accounts: different current and savings accounts fit different life stages and behaviours. For example the Edge Up being geared towards an older demographic with a higher volume of money to spare in a current account, vs the Edge Explorer which is aimed at families. As I have such an in depth knowledge of all our accounts, when there are particular niche needs I am able to provide information that allows the people I serve to consider and make use of additional options most others would miss, for example the Limited Access Saver sharing the same CHAPS fee waiver as some of our other accounts. Some customers need everyday simplicity, some need structured saving, some need features that suit families, and some benefit from accounts designed for customers who hold a higher balance and want stronger interest options. I’m very confident in the ‘niche specs’ and the ‘why’ behind each account, so I can spot when someone’s set up in a way that doesn’t match how they actually use their money. That’s often where outcomes come from: you notice the mismatch, you ask the right questions, then you explain the best-fitting options without advising.”

“Beyond accounts:
If a customer’s need is borrowing for a specific purpose, we’d look at appropriate lending routes and eligibility and, if it’s not suitable to resolve in branch there and then, I’d refer into the correct channel or appointment route.
If their need is protection, it’s about understanding what they’re trying to protect and whether they even want to discuss that today, then signposting the appropriate product area.
If the need is day-to-day convenience, digital services often solve the problem better than another branch visit, and I’ll explain that in plain language and support the customer to use it confidently.”

“What I always keep consistent is: I confirm the need, explain options and key features clearly, check understanding, then support the next step in the safest and simplest way.”

Question 3: Move Together
“Demonstrate how you would assess a customer’s needs and decide whether it’s appropriate to open an account in branch with the customer compared to supporting a customer applying digitally.”

“I decide based on capability, access, urgency, and complexity.”

“First, I assess whether the customer can realistically complete a digital journey: do they have a smartphone, do they have the ID and details with them, do they have the confidence to complete steps without getting stuck later, and is there any vulnerability or barrier that means digital is not appropriate today.”

“If the customer can do it digitally, my default is to support the digital route, because it builds independence and reduces repeat branch visits. As Digital Champion, I’m used to coaching customers through the app and online banking and explaining benefits like convenience, control, and being able to manage accounts without needing an appointment.”

“If they can’t do it digitally, or if there’s a real barrier, for example they don’t have access to online banking, they don’t have the documents available in a way that works digitally, or the situation is urgent and in-person support is genuinely the safest route, then branch completion is appropriate. In that case I keep the process structured: confirm need, confirm eligibility and documents, complete the required checks, and make sure the customer leaves with everything they need to manage the account going forward.”

“I also pay attention to customer emotions and pace. If someone is overwhelmed or embarrassed about not being confident digitally, I keep it respectful and calm, and I adapt my communication so they feel supported rather than judged.”

Question 4: Move Together
“Did the customer understand the benefits of our digital services, and can you give me a recent customer example of when this happened?”

“Yes. A recent example was a customer who came in for help with their business account access. Initially they just wanted the immediate problem solved. I helped them get fully set up, then I used that moment to show how their login could also support their personal accounts in one place, so they could self-serve going forward instead of needing to come back in or wait for an appointment.”

“I kept it practical: I demonstrated the key functions they would actually use, checked they could do it themselves, and explained the benefits in terms that mattered to them, mainly saving time, having visibility, and not being dependent on branch opening times. That’s the moment I look for: not just ‘telling’ them digital exists, but seeing the understanding click because it solves their real-life problem.”

“As Digital Champion, I also support colleagues with updates and create educational resources for them, so digital adoption is something I drive consistently, not occasionally.”

Question 5: Embrace Change
“Can you describe a time where you have been faced with a change in work and how did you approach it?”

“A strong example was when our internal systems changed from Salesforce to Amazon. The older system gave more customer information up front, and the new one felt more stripped back. The risk there is either slowing down service or missing information you previously relied on.”

“My approach was:
First, I worked out exactly what information I used to get automatically, and what decisions it supported.
Second, I identified alternate sources and steps so I could still find what I needed without guesswork.
Third, I tested it in real customer interactions, refined my process, and then shared the ‘new way’ with colleagues so we stayed consistent as a team.”

“I’ve taken the same approach outside banking too, for example when I worked at John Lewis and processes shifted from paper-heavy ordering to more digital workflows. The key was staying positive, being practical, and helping others that I supervised adapt who were unfamiliar with such methods and had only know the more traditional ones for many years, not just adapting myself. This ensured teamwork and productivity remained at full efficiency despite the learning curve.”

“The outcome in both situations was that service quality stayed high during change, and we reduced friction for both customers and colleagues.”

Question 6: I am Risk
“Can you describe what you perceive the biggest risk you could face in your management role and how would you take account of this in your day-to-day activities?”

“The biggest risk is customer harm, either through mistakes, missed red flags, or processes not being followed properly, especially when things are busy. That includes fraud/financial crime risk, operational risk, and vulnerability risk.”

“In day-to-day activity, I manage that by staying disciplined on the basics:
I follow the correct verification and documentation steps every time, even under pressure.
I keep notes audit-ready and factual.
I use a simple internal test: can I complete this safely within policy, and is there anything about this situation that needs specialist review or escalation.
If there are red flags, I don’t ‘reason them away’, I escalate through the correct route.”

“A clear example was identifying activity that looked like structured cash deposits. When another branch was being refurbished their customers came to our branch, and this included a couple who both came in to deposit money into separate accounts. The individual transactions stayed just under a £1000 threshold, but the pattern over time suggested it could be an attempt to avoid automated triggers. This had been happening every other day almost without fail at this other branch with nothing being flagged, nor any explanation for the source of so many funds, and this resembled a known money laundering topology. I treated it as a pattern-based concern, documented objectively, and escalated appropriately rather than trying to handle it alone.”

“I also pay attention to vulnerability and potential financial abuse. If I see indicators, I handle it sensitively, keep the customer safe, and make sure they know what support options exist, again without making assumptions or escalating in the wrong way.”

“In short: I protect the customer and the bank by being consistent, evidence-led, and escalation-ready.”

Question 7 (often asked even if it isn’t printed): Why P2, why now?

“I’m applying for P2 because it matches where I add the most value: structured conversations, needs-based discovery, and completing meaningful outcomes in one interaction. In my current role I can generate strong outcomes even on service and even when I’m on counter, but I’m most effective when I can sit down, assess properly, and action it myself end to end.”

“I also showed initiative early by asking to be trained to open accounts manually, because I want to reduce dependency on whether a customer is digitally set up and increase what I can complete first time. I’ve already shadowed P2 appointments, and I’ve also provided relief to other branches, so I’m comfortable adapting quickly and delivering in different environments.”

Question 8 (outcomes question): Talk me through your outcomes and consistency

“My performance shows two things: capability and conditions. My peak month was September at 63 outcomes, and October was 48. After that, the monthly totals were lower, but they were impacted by condensed annual leave across multiple months, plus around two weeks of training in January and sickness in February. I also work four days a week, so my output per working day is stronger than the monthly totals suggest.”

“When I’m fully present and settled into routine, my baseline is around 4–5 outcomes a day, and on strong service days I can reach up to 8 by spotting opportunities quickly, asking the right questions, and keeping conversations focused and compliant.”

“I also want to be transparent that outcomes can lag because some take a week or more to register, and I’ve picked up pace again in the last couple of weeks, so you’ll see that reflected shortly. My manager can vouch for the trajectory, and I’m also receiving formal recognition for the progress and impact I’ve had.”

“: I started slower, I identified what worked, I locked in, and I proved I can deliver top-level outcomes alongside strong service.”
